        One of the pre-requisites of the <strong>Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA)</strong> Scheme is the formation of
        <strong>State Higher Education Councils (SHEC)</strong> in states. This marks a significant shift in India's higher education policy,
        recognizing states as primary units of planning and aligning multiple funding streams for educational development.

        <p style={{ color: "#34495e" }}>
          The <strong>State Higher Education Councils (SHECs)</strong> are central to the <strong>RUSA vision</strong> of enhancing access, equity, and excellence
          in higher education with better efficiency, transparency, accountability, and responsiveness.
          <br /><br />
          The RUSA scheme aims to deliver crucial academic, administrative, and governance reforms in state education systems.
          Among its sixteen listed objectives, the <strong>16th goal</strong> is to facilitate the creation of SHECs, while the other fifteen
          focus on long-term aspirational policy changes.
