        One of the pre-requisites of the <strong>Rashtriya Uchchatar Shiksha Abhiyan (RUSA)</strong> Scheme is the
        formation of <strong>State Higher Education Councils (SHEC)</strong> in states. This marks a significant shift
        in India's higher education policy, recognizing states as primary units of planning and aligning multiple
        funding streams for educational development.

          The <strong>State Higher Education Councils (SHECs)</strong> are central to the <strong>RUSA vision</strong>{" "}
          of enhancing access, equity, and excellence in higher education with better efficiency, transparency,
          accountability, and responsiveness.
          <br /><br />
          The RUSA scheme aims to deliver crucial academic, administrative, and governance reforms in state education
          systems. Among its sixteen listed objectives, the <strong>16th goal</strong> is to facilitate the creation of
          SHECs, while the other fifteen focus on long-term aspirational policy changes.
