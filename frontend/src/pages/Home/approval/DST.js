        </h3>
        <p className="text-gray-700 text-sm sm:text-base leading-relaxed text-justify">
          The journey of technical education in Bihar began with the establishment of{" "}
          <strong>Bihar College of Engineering, Patna</strong> in 1924, now known as{" "}
          <strong>National Institute of Technology, Patna</strong>. This was the{" "}
          <strong>6th oldest engineering college in India</strong>.
          <br /><br />
          Post-independence, the need for technological manpower led to the founding of{" "}
          <strong>Bihar Institute of Technology, Sindri</strong> in 1949 as the College of Mechanical and Electrical
          Engineering, later relocated to Sindri in 1950. In 1954,{" "}
          <strong>Muzaffarpur Institute of Technology</strong> was also established.
          <br /><br />
          After the bifurcation of Bihar in 2000, Bihar Institute of Technology, Sindri became part of Jharkhand.
          Currently, Bihar has <strong>sixteen engineering colleges</strong> and{" "}
          <strong>seventeen polytechnic institutions</strong> operating effectively.
          <br /><br />
          Since the academic year <strong>2004-05</strong>,{" "}
          <strong>
            Dr. APJ Abdul Kalam Women‚Äôs Institute of Technology, L. N. Mithila University, Darbhanga
          </strong>{" "}
          has been dedicated to providing technical education exclusively to women, after receiving a No Objection
          Certificate (NOC) from the <strong>Department of Science and Technology (DST), Government of Bihar</strong>.
