            The establishment of APJAKWIT in this region is a step forward in
            the context of promoting technical education, especially for the
            upliftment of women of Mithila in particular and India in general.

            field.

          <p className="mt-3">
            We canâ€™t negate that knowledge is the real power in the present age
            of knowledge technology and in the process, the women technocrats
            have a remarkable impact on the overall economic transformation of
            the country.

            The APJAKWIT has proved to be a unique Institute only for the girl
            students, aimed at empowering them to face the changes and
            challenges of the 21st century. I wish the upcoming and budding
